//! The 4-layer safety engine.
//!
//! Governing principle: **L1 is a UX pre-filter; L2 (the database's own
//! read-only session) is the authoritative security boundary.** A parser cannot
//! see through functions, writable CTEs, or dialect quirks — so nothing in this
//! module trusts the model, and every read runs inside a DB-enforced read-only
//! session that rejects a write even when L1 misclassified it.
//!
//! - [`l1_parse`] parse & classify (sqlparser, per-engine dialect)
//! - [`l2_enforce`] authoritative read-only execution
//! - [`l3_preview`] EXPLAIN / execute+rollback impact preview
//! - [`l4_gate`] human-approval decision (the approval card is built frontend-side)
