# Driver architecture

DopeDB separates three concepts that database tools often collapse:

- **Engine**: the wire/query model (`postgres`, `mysql`, `sqlite`, `mongodb`,
  `bigquery`, later `neo4j`).
- **Provider**: a hosting control plane (`generic`, `neon`, `planetScale`, later
  `atlas`, `aura`). A provider never implies one engine; PlanetScale is the immediate
  example because it offers both Vitess/MySQL and PostgreSQL.
- **Driver**: the local adapter that speaks an engine protocol. A saved connection can
  pin `driverId`, or leave it empty so the registry chooses the highest-priority installed
  compatible driver.

```text
Connection form / Agent CLI
        |
        v
Driver registry ---- provider capability overlay
        |
        +---- bundled adapter (SQLx today)
        |
        +---- verified system CLI adapter (`bq`)
        |
        `---- managed sidecar pack (future Mongo/graph packs)
                    |
                    v
               database endpoint
```

## Layer boundaries

1. `model.rs` owns the persisted `engine`, `provider`, and optional `driverId` contract.
2. `driver/mod.rs` owns discovery, recommendation, compatibility validation, install
   state, capabilities, and runtime dispatch.
3. `connection/pool.rs` is an adapter implementation. It knows how to build SQLx pools,
   but does not choose which driver should handle a profile.
4. `connection/providers.rs` owns provider detection and connection tuning. Provider
   behavior must not be encoded as a new SQL driver when the wire protocol is unchanged.
5. Screens consume serializable driver descriptors. They do not hard-code installed
   versions or infer compatibility from package names.

Higher layers must test capabilities (`sql`, `documents`, `graph`, `transactions`,
`introspection`) rather than driver ids. This allows document and graph results to gain
their own workspaces instead of being flattened into SQL tables.

## Installation modes

`bundled` drivers are compiled into the signed application. PostgreSQL, MySQL/MariaDB,
and SQLite currently use this mode through SQLx, so selecting them requires no download.

`system` drivers delegate to an official CLI installed and authenticated by the OS user.
BigQuery uses an app-managed official runtime: it prepares an unmodified,
version/size/SHA-256-pinned Google archive in app-owned local data on first use.
It never selects a workstation SDK or Python installation. macOS also verifies the pinned Python.org installer team and Apple
notarization before extracting its framework without a system install; the Windows x64
archive already contains Python. Activation is staged and atomic, and neither path changes
PATH or needs administrator access. DopeDB neither reads Google tokens nor calls the provider
API itself. SQL is passed over stdin, the executable identity is revalidated for every
invocation, and queries are limited to server-classified `SELECT` statements with dry-run
byte estimates, a per-connection maximum-bytes-billed ceiling, bounded output, timeout, and
exact-job cancellation. Project and dataset identity can be shared in a Workspace, while
every member keeps their own `gcloud` login.

Other `managed` drivers are reserved for independently shipped executable sidecars. Rust crates
cannot safely be downloaded and hot-loaded like JDBC jars: Rust has no stable plugin ABI,
and loading arbitrary dynamic libraries into the Tauri process would expand the trusted
computing base. A managed pack therefore communicates over a versioned local protocol and
can crash or be replaced without corrupting the app process.

A managed pack must not enter the catalog until all of the following exist:

1. Per-platform artifacts for macOS arm64/x64, Windows x64, and supported Linux targets.
2. A versioned driver-host protocol and explicit minimum/maximum app protocol versions.
3. A trusted catalog entry containing artifact size and SHA-256 digest.
4. Signature verification rooted in a public key compiled into the app.
5. Download to a staging path, digest/signature verification, then atomic activation.
6. Storage outside the application bundle with a per-driver/version directory.
7. Rollback to the last verified version and deletion only through the driver manager.

Until those requirements are implemented, a managed catalog entry must remain
`available` and `install_driver` must fail closed rather than execute an unverified file.

## Native provider support

The protocol adapter is only the data plane. Native cloud support belongs in a separate
control-plane client:

- Neon: SQLx PostgreSQL data plane plus projects, branches, computes, roles, databases,
  replicas, and operation polling through the Neon API.
- PlanetScale: SQLx MySQL or PostgreSQL data plane plus branches and provider resources.
  Vitess deploy requests must be capability-gated because PlanetScale PostgreSQL does not
  share that workflow.
- GCP Cloud SQL: SQLx PostgreSQL/MySQL data plane plus a provider adapter that exchanges
  Vercel OIDC through Workload Identity Federation for short-lived IAM DB login tokens.
  The version- and digest-pinned official Cloud SQL Auth Proxy owns instance
  authorization and TLS on a per-pool loopback transport; MySQL cleartext
  authentication is therefore confined to that local verified connector path.
- MongoDB Atlas: the official MongoDB Rust driver for BSON/commands plus the Atlas Admin
  API for managed resources.
- Google BigQuery: the local official `bq` CLI is the data-plane adapter. It is a
  read-only managed official-CLI driver, not a reusable GCP Cloud SQL provider credential
  and not a hosted database proxy.
- Neo4j Aura: a Bolt/Cypher adapter plus the Aura control plane. Graph results remain
  nodes, relationships, and paths.

## Adding a driver

1. Add the engine only when its query and result model is implemented end to end.
2. Add a registry descriptor and capability set.
3. Implement a bundled adapter, a constrained official system-CLI adapter, or publish a
   verified sidecar pack.
4. Add provider overlays independently from the engine adapter.
5. Add contract, persistence, compatibility, and failure-closed tests.
6. Expose the engine-specific editor and result surface only after the adapter is usable.
